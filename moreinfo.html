                    It has been shown that many people interact with avatars the way they would with other humans. Some
                    patients feel more comfortable sharing their difficulties with a machine rather than another
                    person. Some patients have a difficult time feeling comfortable in a therapy room, an emotion
                    AI-powered chatbot can make people feel more comfortable.  The chatbot creates an emotionally safe
                    place for sharing information.
