                Emotion AI is going to stay. This amazing technology can offer patients and professionals a lot of help
                , and it's continuing to get better every day.​

                Because AI is still been developed and is quite young, humans still have to be careful and not rely on
                it completely for everything. However, it is still very reliable, and as I mentioned, it is getting
                better on a daily basis. ​

                Emotion AI is looking for an amzing future in the health and care department and with lots of young
                people making it beter all the time and taking it to the next level working together with professionals
                to address the needs of patients. ​

                    In the future, AI models will be able to help in providing therapy and
                    care for many patients who would not have access to care.
                    Developers still face many problems, but with continuing advances in emotion AI capabilities, the
                    future of technology support for mental healthcare looks amazing.​

                    AI in psychiatry has been a real revolution in many ways. However, it is going to take quite some time for this to still become the norm. As AI becomes more available and more advanced, participating in educational opportunities that determine how algorithms help clinical decision-making and what data they contain will help with the transition process. <br><br>
